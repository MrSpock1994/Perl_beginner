#A scalar data is the simplest kind of data that Perl can modify
#Scalars can only hold one value
#Scalars values are usually numbers or strings of characters
#Scalar values can be used with different operators, returning back a result
#The scalar result can be saved into a Scalar variable
#They can also be read or written from files or devices
